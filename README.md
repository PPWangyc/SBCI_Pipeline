# SBCI
Surface-Based Connectivity Integration

This is an advanced MRI post-processing pipeline that builds structural connectivity (SC) and functional connectivity (FC) on the white matter surface of the brain and returns three imaging biomarkers representative of the relationships between SC and FC.

What you will need:
1. T1w anatomical data
2. Multi-shell dwi data
3. Resting-state fMRI data
